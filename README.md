## vaccHTTP
This is a variable that links to the vACC's API. 
It allows the vACC to activate areas in ways we couldn't imagine. 

For example:
Activate area's based on active runways, meteorological conditions, the ab-/presence of a controller position or for example the traffic load. 
It also allows the vACC to manually activate areas and activate or set an area's limit based on the activity and limits of other areas. 

You can customise this fully to your vACC's needs. 
The accepted format is TopSky schedules. 

## Extra attributes
For each area you can optionally add the following keys:
- "entry_conditions" - These are the entry conditions for said area. E.g.: Radio Mandatory Zone - Area reserved to participating a/c - Prohibited to all a/c - ...
- "remark" - Any information you wish to share. E.g.: EBCI SOPOK3K, MEDIL3Y unavailable - Sanicole Airshow - ...
Keep in mind, that these will show every time your area activates! (Unless overwritten by vaccHTTP.)
