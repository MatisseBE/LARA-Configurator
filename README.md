## vaccHTTP
This is a variable that links to the vACC's API. 
It allows the vACC to activate areas in ways we couldn't imagine. 

For example:
Activate area's based on active runways, meteorological conditions, the ab-/presence of a controller position or for example the traffic load. 
It also allows the vACC to manually activate areas and activate or set an area's limit based on the activity and limits of other areas. 

You can customise this fully to your vACC's needs. 
The accepted format is TopSky schedules.
